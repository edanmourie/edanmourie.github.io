              <b>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, 
                the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</b><br>
              - At my last job we had many people from all over the country calling for assistance, and often we had to make 
              judgement calls on what to do for them. Once instance I remember was when a man called for assistance, but I denied him immediate 
              assistance due to his past dealings with us and information I had about him from previous interactions. I gave him an alternative 
              that meant he could have received assistance later in the day if he wanted to do it ASAP. <br><br>
              - I was thinking about what was fair and responsible from my point of view. It would be unfair for me to assist this person who has 
              given us grief over past assistance, when I have not given assistance to someone who has caused no issues at all (however due to other reasons).
              I thought it would be responsible to follow the advice of people who had interacted with this client in the past, and ways to deal with him. <br><br>
              - This led to the client getting upset, and threatening a local centre, so I had to call the local centre and the police to let them know about it. 
              Apparently, he has threatened that place a few times, so they weren’t too worried about him, which helped me stay calm.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</b><br>
              - I feel like as an individual I have very little in the way of culture. I understand that culture can mean so many things to different people, 
              but I look at it in the view of traditions, beliefs, and teachings from past and current generations. My family and friends all seem to be relatively 
              progressive people, and none of them have pushed any agendas on me (of course passively it has happened). I kind of just do my own thing and try to 
              stay out of other people’s business unless they invite me in to learn. I think people can do whatever they want, and believe whatever they want, and 
              I’ll support them if they want to do so, so long as no harm comes to anyone involved. <br><br>
              - My identity has been shaped in a similar way, I feel that as an individual I tend to just focus on myself and what I do. I would describe myself as 
              a passive, nerdy introvert, who likes gaming, D&D, and other stuff – but I can’t really land on something that I want to do in the future.

              <b>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</b><br>
              - My strengths in terms of learning are that I really love to learn and teach, and I learn quickly. I feel like I can explain things to people in simple 
              and complicated ways (if I understand the complicated part) effectively. <br><br>
              - My limitations of learning are somewhat related to my strengths. Due to the fact I learn quickly, sometimes things pop out of my head as soon as new 
              ones come in, that is why I really like doing study in the “flipped learning” kind of way – I like to learn the thing, then implement/use it in a 
              relevant way so it gets stuck in my head. Also, due to the fact I think I can learn quickly, sometimes I leave things to the last minute and do a poor 
              job compared to if I spent more time on it. <br><br>
              - A strength I have in career development is that I am a very passionate person about the things I like, so when I work somewhere that aligns with my 
              passions, I have a much better time. <br><br>
              - My largest limitation in career development is I have worked very few places, for little time. I have only had one full-time job, but it did not align 
              with me, so I was only there for a few months. I had another part-time job that I did for years because I really liked the people and the values. Due to 
              working in so few places, combined with having anxiety, it is hard for me to imagine working in a new place, in a job I don’t know what I need to do, by 
              reading an overly complex job description that may or may not be accurate.

            <p>
              <b>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</b><br>
              - I think that the enjoyment I get from learning and teaching something new is my biggest strength for my learning journey. When I trained to be a secondary 
              school teacher the concept of Ako really stuck with me, the reciprocal teacher-student relationship – which I am excited to experience in a new setting with 
              new people and peers, overcoming new and difficult obstacles.

              <b>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies 
                you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</b><br>
              - When I was training to become a teacher, you get lots of resistance and tension from students. The strategies I used would of course only work in an in-person 
              classroom setting in a high school. The only thing the students hated more than learning was having minutes of their lunch break taken away. So, if the students 
              caused distractions, their name got added to the list of people staying behind during lunch, and if they did good work their name got taken off again. I used this 
              method because it was effective, I would try to not use this in the future. <br><br>
              - The above strategy was probably the most effective when dealing with the younger year students, however I think it would be less effective with older students. 
              I think if I became a teacher full time, I would try to create a system that rewards students for being good in class instead of punishing them for causing distractions, 
              because it’s not very fair for the students who are good all the time when they get no reward, and its not very fair to the students who cause distractions to have their 
              free time taken away from them.
