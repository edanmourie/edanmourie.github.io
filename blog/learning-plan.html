            <b>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</b><br>
            - My dream IT job would be working in game development, as I love playing games. A realistic goal is to get a job in web development or IT support.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A description of my strength and limitations when it comes to learning.</b><br>
            - Strengths = Love to learn, love to overcome learning blocks, learn quickly.<br>
            - Limitations = Sometimes I learn too quickly and then I forget things.

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>What skills (non-technical core/human skills would I like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy?</b><br>
            - Working with other people in IT, understanding the different ways people work and how they do their work.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.</b><br>
            - In the past I have been slack when it comes to finishing my work early. So far in foundations, 
            I have started the sprint on Monday morning, and I have had lots of time to get it done. I will commit to sticking to this schedule, 
            I will make sure to finish everything before the due date, within a comfortable time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way.</b><br>
            - I read and/or watched somewhere in the course that if you’re stuck on something for 30-60mins, then you should reach out for help. In foundations 
            there is the #tech-questions and #core-questions. I am assuming that #help-requests channel will stick around, and that channel is used if another student 
            can’t answer your questions for you. My final option in foundations is to post in my #hg2 chat for help from my facilitator/group members.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A description of what I expect from the Facilitation team.</b><br>
            - I just expect people to be nice and understanding, and not to get frustrated if I ask the same question 50 times. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Scheduling information (block-out times) when I am committed to other things.</b><br>
            - My partner gets home from work around 5pm, and I usually stop what I’m doing and cook dinner when she gets home. During bootcamp I would likely stop when the day is over (5:15pm?) to cook.
