          <p><b>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</b><br>
          - From what I have found many of the principles can sort of be group together, the main grouping I will mention is “Use it”. Do the thing you want to get better at and use that part of your brain. Use it again to improve that part of your brain. Repeat the same task to strengthen your neural circuits that help you accomplish the activity you are doing.</p>
          <p><b>How I might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit.</b><br>
          - If I get stuck on a really hard piece of code, I know that hacking away at it will strengthen some part of my brain, and if I encounter the code again I will be strengthening it even more. I should aim to use challenging pieces of code more because repeating it makes it easier.</p>
          <p><b>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</b><br>
          - The few things I have mentioned above are some of the most effective ways to increase neuroplasticity – Use it, improve it, and repeat it. A key factor in neuroplasticity is age, so the earlier you start something the more likely you brain will be able to grow with it.</p>
          <p><b>Link to a resource that I found particularly useful or engaging.</b><br>
          <a href="https://www.neuroskills.com/brain-injury/neuroplasticity/ten-principles-of-neuroplasticity/" target="_blank">The Ten Principles of Neuroplasticity.</a><br>- These are the principles I read, which I found extra informative due to them linking the principles to read life context, i.e. The swallowing example under "Use it or Lose it". </p>
          <p><b>Discuss what growth mindset is and why it is relevant.</b><br>
          - Growth mindset is the idea that if you think you can learn it, you will be able to. If you think you can’t learn it, you never will, or you will struggle greatly in doing so. It is relevant because as Carol Dweck said in her TED talk, it should become a human right to teach people about the growth mindset, because it massively benefits people in their life, especially children and teenagers.</p>
          <p><b>In this exploration, did anything surprise me? Change for me?</b><br>
          - Seeing how much the average person improved when taught about the growth mindset was pretty surprising.</p>
          <p><b>How will I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?</b><br>
          - I think I have been using a growth mindset accidentally. I haven’t been talking myself down when I get stuck, I have enjoyed challenges and I have had a lot of happiness when I figure out how to do something.</p>
          <p><b>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</b><br>
          <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/" target="_blank">Mindsetworks.com</a><br> - This article used Carol Dweck’s research on the growth mindset, which had good info and stats to reflect on after watching her TED talk.</p>
          <p><b>Reflection and discussion on how these understandings may shape or influence my learning plan and strategy</b><br>
          - I don’t think that learning about growth mindset or neuroplasticity will really change the way my learning plan was. As I mentioned before I have already been viewing study from this viewpoint without knowing what these are. If anything it’s just made my outlook more positive on the study and I continue to look forward to learning new things. </p>
