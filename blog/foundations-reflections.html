            <strong>What are three new thins I have learnt about myself and my ego due to the core learning?</strong><br>
            - I have learnt that I treat myself well mentally and I don't beat myself up over not understanding something.<br>
            - My ego doesn't take over and assume I can do everything, and it doesn't take too big of a hit when I fail at something.<br>
            - I don't really like doing mindfulness/it's not very effective for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</strong><br>
            - I think values, empathy, and self-awareness are great tools for an individual when learning an programming. Firstly, you need to improve these things upon yourself, if you are your own harshest critic but you don't even know it things can get pretty rough. Secondly, show these things to other people, because not everyone learns or codes the same way you do, at the same speed you do.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What has surprised me the most about the core learning?</strong><br>
            - I don't think anything has particularly surprised me, if anything it's that DevAcademy actually cares about your core skills. The part that mattered the most to be was neuroplasticity and the growth mindset.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong><br>
            - Writing about myself and posting it for everyone to see. I don't really like writing about myself so the learning plan, identity, values, and strengths were challenging for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</strong><br>
            - You say that businesses don't care about the best marks and best coding ability. Businesses care about core skills because they want good humans on their team, that will make their team a better place to be. They can teach you the programming skills easier than core skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong><br>
            - For me, it feels like it a bit of a waste of time. In saying that, the core section was always incredibly easy for me to do and often didn't take much time at all.<br>
            - The reason I say it's a bit of a waste of time is because I feel like I already have decent core skills. When doing the neuroplasticity/growth mindset section I wrote about how I was already thinking that way without knowing it.<br>
            - I think core skills will show their worth during bootcamp when we are properly interacting and working with people every day.
