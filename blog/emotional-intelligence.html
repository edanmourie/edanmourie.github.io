            <b>What is emotional intelligence?</b><br>
            - The ability to perceive, control, evaluate and express emotions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>How is it different to IQ?</b><br>
            -	I would describe IQ more as book smarts – a person with high IQ can answer questions by using information provided alongside logic.<br>
            -	I would then describe EQ as people smarts – a person with high EQ can more easily relate to other people, can understand both their own and 
            other people’s emotions, and they can control displaying their emotions (such as anger).

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Why is it important?</b><br>
            - It is important because people who are emotionally intelligent are supposedly more likely to be successful than those with high IQ. Aside 
            from being successful, having high EQ makes people feel like you are more trustworthy, easier to talk to, and more likely to listen and learn from you.
            High EQ also helps your ability to know yourself, which allows you to better manage and express all emotions in a way that is productive and positive, instead
            of sometimes being unproductive and negative.
