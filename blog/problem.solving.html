            <strong>When I was blocked on a simple problem:</strong><br>
            I got blocked on a lot of problems this week, but I think the simplest problem I was stuck on was being able to understand how to use different built-in methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tried pseudocoding for those challenges (some I must have deleted on accident) which helped me organise how I would tackle the challenge. I console.logged a lot, and used a lot of help from my peers (I didn't have to ask, as many people had asked already).
          </p>
          <p>
            I felt pretty unconfident in my abilities, I got stuck on pretty much every challenge. I feel like I missed learning somewhere, but I haven't because I've done everything, it must just be a gap in my understanding of the code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though I struggled I feel like I learned a lot and I am going away from this week feeling good overall. I have reflected on the challenges and when I look at it I think "This code make sense, I get it". I don't think I've fully remembered it but I know I have these completed challenges I can look at if I need to double check how to do something.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>When I elegantly solved a problem:</strong><br>
            The main problem I had with the "Manipulating JS Objects" challenge was figuring out how to declare an object within an object i.e. terah.children = { ben: { }}. For this problem I mainly did googling and it clicked pretty fast, I think I was only missing the : after ben. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This was one challenge I felt confident in, and I still took things away like the aforementioned way of making an object within an object.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Reflecting on how confident I feel about the below problem-solving techniques/processes.</strong><br>
            <em>Pseudocode</em> - Pseudocoding definitely helps me and I am confident is putting down the larger picture in pseudocode. I am not confident with my ability to put down functions/parameters/etc within the pseudocode yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Trying something</em> - I am fully confident in my ability to try things. A lot of the time they don't work, but thats the point of trying things.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Rubber ducky method</em> - I haven't encountered a challenge this week where I thought the rubber ducky method would be applicable. I have sort of used it in the past so I am semi-confident I can use it in a helpful way.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Reading error messages</em> - I have been using error messages a lot in the last two weeks, I would say I'm confident in understanding an error message at this point.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Console.log</em> - This week in particular I console.logged a lot of stuff. I definitely am not using it to it's full potential but I am getting confident with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Googling</em> - I am a confident googler.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Asking peers for help</em> - I haven't asked for help myself yet, but I have read a lot of the threads on discord and I am confident my peers would help if I did ask myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Asking coaches for help</em> - I haven't had to do this yet because any questions I've had have already been answered in #tech-questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Improving your process with reflection</em> - This is something I have mainly started doing this week as I was feeling unconfident in most of the challenges. I don't think I quite use this problem-solving process to it's full capability, but I am starting to get into it as things get more commplicated.
