<!-- 
What is my site's primary purpose?
-- My sites primary purpose is to create a blog that shows my journey throughout Dev Academy. It is more a diary than anything else.

Who is my audience? (is it kids, adults, academics)?
-- Myself and other people from Dev Academy who may want to see how my journey is going / went.

How will I build my site to support their user experience?
-- Make sure sizing of text, images, etc, will fit any device.
-- Make sure the layout looks good and is clear and easy to use.

Wireframe - can I draw my site layout on paper? Draw it!
-- I have drawn it.

What other directories do I need (e.g. images)? Where do I put that directory?
-- I have made this directory, within the edanmourie.github.io folder

Do I also want the style to be applied to all of my blog entries?
-- I might try and make all of the sprints have different fonts, I would class the body and heads so I can target them specifically, e.g. <head class="main head"> blah blah </head>
